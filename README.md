# Getting Director's approval for a new W3C maturity level (aka transition requests)

For all requests to advance a specification to a new [maturity level](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#maturity-levels) other than [Note](), the Working Group must obtain [Director approval](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#transition-reqs). This is a  repository for requesting Director's approval when advancing on the W3C Recommendation track. It contains the transition requirements document, available from [Organize a Technical Report Transition](https://www.w3.org/Guide/transitions), and an issues tracker for managing transition requests. Tags are used to manage the transitions, keeping track of who has the “ball”. Notifications are sent by email to various mailing lists, include [public-transition-announce](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-transition-announce/) and [chairs](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/).

Select one of the transition templates below:

* First Public Working Draft: [FPWD transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* First Public Working|Interest Note: [FPNote transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Ordinary Working Draft: no Director's approval needed, just use Echidna.
* Ordinary Working|Interest Group Note: no Director's approval needed, just use Echidna.
* Candidate Recommendation: [CR transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Updating a Candidate Recommendation with only editorial changes: no Director's approval needed, just use Echidna.
* Updating a Candidate Recommendation with substantive changes: [Updated CR transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Proposed Recommendation: [PR transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Proposal to Supersede a Recommendation: [Superseded transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Proposal to Obsolete a Recommendation: [Obsoleted transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Recommendation: Due to the need to look at the AC Review comments, those transitions are done by the Team separately
* Edited Recommendation: [Edited REC transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)

If you're not sure what transition template to use, check out our [next step finder](https://w3c.github.io/transitions/nextstep.html) to see your choices.

## Further Guidance

  * If you're not sure how to fill the template properly, see [Organize a Technical Report Transition](https://www.w3.org/Guide/transitions).
  * If you need to convey Member-confidential information, start a thread on w3c-archive@w3.org and link it from your issue; lists.w3.org's access control will manage permissions. Use w3t-archive@w3.org instead for Team-confidential infos.
  * Assign your editor(s) and staff contact(s) to the transition request issue to facilitate automatic pestering.
  * Untag "Awaiting ..." if you intend to continue editing the issue before requesting action; you will need to add these back later.
  * Issues get closed once publication is complete *and* relevant announcements are posted.
